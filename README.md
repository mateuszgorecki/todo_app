## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - For styles
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - For better habits
- [Context API](https://react.dev/reference/react/createContext) - For managing theme and tasks
- [react-beautiful-dnd](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd) - For drag&drop
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) - Hosting


### Continued development

- In the next projects I want to try different way to managing state like Redux, MobX or React Query.
- I want to learn things like Node.js, Docker, MongoDB, GraphQL to make fullstack apps
- Another thing is to add unit test and error handling to this and other projects
